# **Snatch & Flag**
- ##### The web purpuse is to present my **MVH** project for this year about my small game of **Snatching & Flag** and fighting your opponent in local duel
- ##### In this **WA** project I used: 
    1. ###### *Bootsrap 5.3 + HTML*
    2. ###### *PhP*
    3. ###### *.htaccess*
- ##### For launching my web you will need:
    1. ###### *GitHub*
    2. ###### *MySQL*
    3. ###### *XAMPP Control Panel*
    4. ###### *Visual Studio Code or other program that use C# Language*
### How to use:
- ##### 1. First of all open the project in Visual Studio Code and create a Database *(Remember your name of User, Database and Password, these will use in the next step)*
- ##### 2. In the second part take the **Database name, User name** and **Password**, in **Visual Studio Code** and in **logic.php** click on **DBC.php** and fill out them out like this: 
    - **HOST** = *(localhost:portNumber)* 
    - **USER** = *(User name) <- Your Database User*  
    - **PASSWORD** = *(Password) <- Your Database Password* 
    - **DATABASE** = *(Database name) <- Your Database name*
- ##### 3. Lunch **XAMPP** and start the **Apache + MySQL**
- ##### 4. After that you should have everything set up and the only thing missing is for you to start it up through web browser writing in the URL bar localhost after you started the **XAMPP** **Apache** and **MySQL**
